This project aims to automate the initial creation of a README.md file for GitHub repositories. It addresses the common problem of repositories lacking adequate documentation upon creation. The generator takes repository metadata as input and outputs a formatted README file, providing a foundation for further refinement. The target audience is developers who want a quick and easy way to generate a starter README file for their projects. It distinguishes itself by automating a normally manual and sometimes overlooked step in the project creation process.
